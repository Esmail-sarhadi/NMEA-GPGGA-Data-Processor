# NMEA-GPGGA-Data-Processor
This project is a C++ application that reads and processes NMEA GPGGA sentences from a text file. The program extracts useful information such as time, latitude, longitude, and the number of satellites in view from each GPGGA sentence. The extracted data is then displayed in a readable format.
